In addition to Marcel's version linked to below, ForthInc has posted an [http://forth.com/starting-forth/ online edition of Starting Forth] which AFAICT has the original images.

==== Comments on the Web Edition ====
/Starting Forth, First Edition is from 1981. These web pages were entered from memory in 2003, when it became apparent that SF might never be re-issued by the copyright holder. A small supply of about 500 books is all that was available in April 2003. When you can get hold of the original, do so./

/This transcript is inaccurate. Forth code has been converted to the ANSI standard. Where necessary, statements that were valid in 1981 have been exchanged with statements more appropriate for 2003./

/Starting Forth is full of very difficult to reproduce graphics. These enormously enhance the text's mnemonic value, and are invaluable for a first-time Forth user. I have therefore added "substitute" graphic elements, roughly at the same spot where they are in the original. The original graphics are, of course, much better./
