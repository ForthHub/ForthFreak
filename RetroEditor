The !RetroEditor is a line oriented block editor orginally written for use with RetroForth. It's a major part of the development environment in !RetroForth, and is reasonably portable. See [RetroEditorPorts] for implementations for various Forth systems.

Please note that in !RetroForth, blocks are 8x64, rather than 16x64. This allows blocks to map directly to physical sectors in the native version, and doesn't hinder programming under a host OS. In fact, it's easy to use one block for code and the other as "shadow" block for comments.

==== Editing commands

  block#  s                 Select new block
  line#   i ...             Insert ... onto line#
  column#  line#  ia ...    Insert ... onto line# at column#
  x                         Delete the current block
  line#   d                 Delete line# from the current block
  p                         Select previous block
  n                         Select next block
  v                         View the current block
  e                         Evaluate the current block

==== Commands for loading/saving blockfiles in RetroForth

  #blocks  blocks           Set the number of blocks to load/save
  use filename              Set the filename to load/save
  load filename             Set the filename, and load it for editing
  reload                    Read the file to memory
  save                      Write the file to disk

==== Notes

While editing on a line by line basis can be tedious at times, it's certainly doable, and makes extending the editor very, very simple. (See RetroEditorExtensions for some of these)
