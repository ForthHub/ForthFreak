A tokenizer converts Forth source into byte code.

Tokenizers will each use:

* a list of ByteCodePrimitives that are the only commands the tokenizer will compile into byte-code (The tokenizer may also create new tokens that the code itself defines using only existing tokens.)
* a collection of StandardTokenizerRoutines that most tokenizers will have in common
* some code from a collection of optional routines that tokenizers may use
* possibly new code that is specific for that tokenizer

We provide here:

* standard routines that most tokenizers could use
* a collection of optional routines that may be useful
* a sample tokenizer/token-compiler pair
* minimal debugging tools
* a simple decompiling tool
