Holon is a new kind of cross-platform development system based on the programming language Forth. The development system (host) is able to work interactively on the living application program (target).

HOLON-LT (lite) is a fully functional demonstration version of HOLON-86, which builds target programs on DOS platforms. You can use it for real programming.
