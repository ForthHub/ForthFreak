Fork is a Forth interpreter written using an intermediate language for a custom virtual machine.

Features:
* The core is written in a custom language for a virtual machine, with 24 primitive opcodes. This permit the compiled image of the base system to be machine-independent.
* Implemented vocabulary follows DPANS CORE, but some words are not fully compatible to the above standard, this due to my personal need.
* 64 x 16 Block editor.
* Big part of hi-level forth words defined inside the blocks and available to the user.
* The low level virtual machine instructions can be mixed and used together with forth.
