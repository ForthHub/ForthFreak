Retrospect is a debugger written in RetroForth. It's not quite complete yet, but already does quite a bit of useful things. It isn't likely to run on other Forths without (possibly significant) changes.

Users of !RetroForth (Release 8) can load it by doing the following:

  load lib/retrospect e

If you'd like to [http://retro.tunes.org/repos/retroforth/_darcs/current/common/lib/retrospect view] the code, you can do so. Please note that this is a BlockFile. 
What's complete:

* Hexdump a word
* Resolve addresses to names
* Decompile (disassemble) words to their assembly equivilents, with comments and names of words.
* Inspect registers

What's coming:

* Single step execution
* Mini hex editor
* Better integration with the RetroEditor
