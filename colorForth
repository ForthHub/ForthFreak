colorForth is a dialect of Forth that uses color to replace punctuation. It is intended to be used as an operating system, though it has been ported to some of the more popular operating systems as well. 

See http://www.colorforth.com/ for more details and downloads of the original release. The latest version is labeled "July 31", though a newer version is being worked on and will hopefully be released soon.
