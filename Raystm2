[Raystm2] is Raymond A. St. Marie ii

Ray is a programming hobbyiest specializing in minimalist [Forth]s with a concetration on [colorForth] and other colored [Forth]s. 

He maintains [http://colorforthray.info].

Other minimalist [Forth]s Ray has used to some extent include but not limited to:
* [EnthFlux] by [SeanPringle]
* [RetroForth] since version 5 or so... by [CharlesChilders]
* Glypher, a colorforth-alike all inclusive game creation environment by [RogerLevy].
* Toka -- This also by [CharlesChilders] is brilliant but wait till you see what it does to RETRO10

One thing Ray likes to do is program chess table games as his "Hello, World!" proggies and has written many interesting versions for several [Forth]s including [colorForth] -- "no AI as of yet but these boards can tipically be driven by any AI that uses a subset of the Chess Algebra, namely source/destination square names like e2e4 as one option."

Ray is dealing with health issues that can take him off line for many days at a time. He also credits IRC chat with saving his mental life.
