This is a Gcc/Relocatable/fAst/Small/Portable Forth

graspForth is an attempt at a Forth-in-C that has the following goals:

* GCC
** /to support all 32-bit micros that GCC cross-compiles to/
* Relocatable
** /to be able to run in-place in either Flash or Ram/
* Fast 
** /to be "not much" slower than an assembly based native Forth/ 
* Small 
** /to fit-in approx 300 words in less than 25Kbytes on a 32-bit machine/
* Portable 
** /to achieve a 5 minute port to a new 32bit micro-processor, or micro-controller./
