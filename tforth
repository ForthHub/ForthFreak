tForth is a Forth with parallel facilities. It generates code for the INMOS range of transputers.

From 1990 to 1994, tForth was the main project of the DFW, the Dutch Forth Workshop. tForth implements all words of the current ANS-Forth standard (all words). Version 2.0 is made available for non-commercial use at the side below.
(In the future probably GPL.)
