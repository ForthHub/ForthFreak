Features:
* Subroutine-threaded: The Forth definitions compile directly to compiled Perl subroutines.
* Interactive access to Perl from Forth.
* Not much else :)  It doesn't actually DO very much, but it was a fun hack.

A design goal was to implement the working Forth kernel in a mininal amount of Perl code, then bootstrap the remainder of the language in the context of the working interpreter/compiler. Note that much of this bootstrap code is Perl ``assembly code''; but just being able to compile it on the Forth side seemed to me a worthwhile distinction.
