Hi,

I'm using Forth primarily for scripting interactive graphics.  

I'm using Ficl to develop a client API for my new window system called NexX.  NexX is primarily written in COOP/C, but I enjoy the dynamic abilities of Forth, and the quick debugging and testing in the client interface.  I've thought recently about rewriting more of the core in Forth.

On this wiki I've shared code using my initials - GPS.  I used Tcl for many years prior to this, so it has influenced my style. It's very nice to find a Forth community wiki.
