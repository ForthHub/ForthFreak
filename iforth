iForth's most important goal is to define a computer interface that combines the ease of use and flexibility of an interpreter with the run-time execution speed expected of a modern optimizing compiler. The iForth command line gives access to all features provided by the host Operating System. iForth has many system-dependent libraries like e.g. graphics and sound, where the API's are layered such that they stay the same on all supported OS's (Windows, Linux and MSDOS).

Distinguishing features of iForth are its scientific computation support (BLAS, LaPACK), its electrical engineering toolsets (plotting and visualization, interfaces to Matlab, MathCAD, Mathematica, Excel), and its over 4000 example programs.

Note that iForth is [https://order.kagi.com/?AMP not free], but once you acquire it, it is allowed to distribute applications that include 'open' interpreters without any copyright restrictions whatsoever.
