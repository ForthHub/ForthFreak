QBFORTH is simple Forth system written in QBASIC.

Features:
* Hexadecimal numbers are written by $ at the beginning, rather than the HEX mode to set base
* Simple definitions of IF THEN etc.
* Use for whatever you want to use it for. But don't patent it or similar things like that
* Includes GOTO command
* If you put filenames on command-line, it will read them in order, compile to DIC.MEM EXEC.MEM MISC.MEM and then execute QBFORTH without filenames to execute the MAIN word
* It has a few differences from other Forth, but some of these differences are only because I didn't know much about Forth when I invented QBFORTH. But some other differences are just because I think it is better that way (such as using $ for hexadecimal numbers instead of HEX mode)
