44 is a small, rather loosely characterized version of forth. It has a number of standard words, such as @, !, emit, key, etc., but does not even come close to implementing the core wordset for an ANS-type forth. It includes a small extension to the language that the author considers nice, but it will doubtlessly annoy savants at large.

44 was written for emedded !PowerPC use. It can act as a monitor or be used to develop !ROMable applications.
