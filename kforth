kForth is an implementation of the Forth programming language and environment. The user may write Forth programs with an ordinary text editor, load these program files from kForth, and run them. kForth, like other implementations of Forth, provides an interactive environment, allowing the user to examine or define variables and execute or define individual words. There are many advantages in using a Forth environment for writing and testing computer programs. kForth provides a significant subset of the ANS specification for the Forth language. It also provides some extensions and "non-standard" features which its authors have found to be useful.
