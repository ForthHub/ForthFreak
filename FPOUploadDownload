Need a way to synchronise files between host and developer systems. We don't want to download everything everybody has uploaded. (Unless somebody does want that. It could be an option.)

So somehow you must choose what you want to upload. And choose what you want to download.

You must upload not only the files but also the links among these files and to other files. If, like a wiki, those links are embedded in the files, that isn't an extra step.

Once that choice is made, it would work like a standard version control system except that when you update somebody else's file it becomes a branch, and you own the new branch. The FPO should be designed to allow users to use version control with a minimum of fuss. It should take what you give it, and give you what you ask for.
