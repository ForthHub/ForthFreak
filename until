/until/ is a Forth-like language written in C for extreme portability. 
Versions of Until run on at least four operating systems, compiled with
five different C compilers. Until has about 95% of the functionality of
a full Forth system; plus some features available in few if any other
Forth's. It was designed from the ground up to be embedded in other
programs and used as a 'macro' language. Both calling other C functions
and being called by other C functions is extremely easy with Until.
