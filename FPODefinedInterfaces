Currently, in very general terms the specs are dividing up into:

* Legacy version control system   
** Store diffs. 
** Provide files for display or modification.
** Provide diffs for analysis.


* Trees   Arranged precisely analogous to a tree of wiki pages. 
** Load files 
** Run tests.
** Refine specifications. 
Perhaps only a small addition to wiki code.

* User interface   Probably look like a wiki. 
** Do searches. 
** Follow links. 
** Observe diffs. 
** Write to pages.
** Create links.
** Compile code.
** Run tests.
** Convert bug reports into tests, place in test tree. 
** Upload changes.
** Download what looks interesting. 

Make the mechanism transparent enough that users can easily put in their own preferred development systems -- their own text editors, their own search functions, whatever.
