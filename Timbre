Timbre is a script driven translator engine. It uses rules and rule sets to determine how to transform input into output. It has been used for language translation, target compilation, meta-compiling, code verification, binary viewing, code documentation and RTF parsers and reformatters. Timbre was meant to capture the essence of translation allowing for very simple yet powerful ways of translating anything to anything. One example included in the distribution is for source to source translation with peephole optimization.
