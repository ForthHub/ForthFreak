Started on 2006Oct18, the [http://forum.forthfreak.net ForthFreak Forum] is meant to attach to the wiki, as a medium for easier talking.
Sometimes wiki pages have been used to carry user correspondence. Those are not ideal - a forum fits that purpose probably better. 
As individual articles can be added to the wiki, or wiki pages address from the forum, both wiki and forum have the potential to mesh. 

[http://forum.forthfreak.net/viewtopic.php?t=1 test linking to a forum article]

In addition does the forum offer facilities which the wiki doesn't:
Polls, threads, instant messenging and chat, and some more to be discovered. The forum is meant to help the wiki to become a repository for less volatile information, while carrying the exchanges which require a higher amount of interactivity with other users.

As examples: the [http://wiki.forthfreak.net wiki] pages dealing with M8C (M8cOverviewOfPages) and Forth Project Organizer (FPOOverviewOfPages) may be better candidates for the forum than for the wiki, as probably most more conceptual talks are.

Please edit me.

/Unfortunately, as of 2006-11-02, I'm getting error messages such as:/

"message_die() was called multiple times. This isn't supposed to happen. Was message_die() used in page_tail.php?"

/and:/
  phpBB : Critical Error
  Could not open Fallen template config file
  DEBUG MODE
  Line : 503
  File : functions.php

/I hope this is just a temporary glitch./

uh-oh ... looks like running multiple (supposedly seperate) boards went wrong. Those supposedly share the same database, with different table prefixes. They should, I mean. Evidently, they don't. This needs some serious fixing. For now, the forum is, as consequence, off-line, sorry.
