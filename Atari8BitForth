There are several FORTH Systems for ATARI b-Bit Computers around. Most of this FORTH are FigForth variants, but some are even supported and developed today.
 
Implementations for ATARI 8Bit Computer (6502 CPU):

* X-Forth -- still in development, will become ANSI compatible FORTH someday, file based (with DOS)
* FigForth 1.0d -- old FORTH Version, disk-block based (without DOS)
* FigForth 1.1 -- Enhanced FigForth, disk-block based (without DOS)
* Learn-Forth -- Subset of FigForth from HOFACKER (Order No.7053), disk-block based (without DOS) as well on cassette
* Power-Forth -- Extended FigForth from HOFACKER (Order No.7055), disk-block based (without DOS)
* Antic Forth 1.4s -- very powerfull ANTIC Forth, disk-block based (without DOS)
* QS-Forth 1.0 -- QS-Forth, disk-block based (without DOS)
* Mesa FORTH -- Mesa FORTH
* Graphic FORTH -- A ANTIC Forth 1.4s with special extensions, mostly in german language  
* ES Forth -- English Software Company FORTH, file-based FORTH (with DOS)  
* SNAUT -- A FORTH 83 comaptible Standard FORTH. The only trace of this FORTH is an advertising in a german magazin for now
* Yet another Target Compiler -- Target Compiler for creating MAC/65 Source from FORTH
