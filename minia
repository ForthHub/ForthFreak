*minia* is the "!MINimalistic Interface Accessories" toolkit. It's currently actively developed by HelmarWodtke and implemented in his HelFORTH.

The announce for this project you can read here http://maschenwerk.de/HelFORTH/forum/index?msg_id=43

It uses the cairo graphics library http://cairographics.org as main rendering facility. So there are a lot of possible targets for this toolkit to run on, including !OpenGL, X11, Windows and framebuffers. The toolkit's implementation language is FORTH with some C glue code generated by perl scripts.

Programmers that want to cooperate with this project are hereby invited to do so.
