== Displaying Source Code ==
* Here is some Javascript code:
    function changeSlide(i) {
        var myForm = document.getElementsByTagName("form")[0];
        var myNum = myForm.getElementsByTagName("input")[0];
        i = i * 1;
        myVal = myNum.value * 1;
        myNum.value = myVal + i;
        myForm.submit();
    }
* Here is some Perl code:
    sub process {
        my ($self) = @_;
        return $self->cgi->size ? $self->open_window 
                                : $self->slide;
    }
