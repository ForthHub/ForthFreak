 \ Hmm, this would be a good application for ]] ... [[

 \ The program uses the following words
 \ from CORE :
 \ : POSTPONE THEN ; immediate ?dup IF 0= 
 \ from BLOCK-EXT :
 \ \ 
 \ from FILE :
 \ ( 

 : ENDIF ( compilation orig -- ; run-time -- ) \ gforth
    POSTPONE then ; immediate

 : ?DUP-IF ( compilation -- orig ; run-time n -- n| ) \ gforth	question-dupe-if
    POSTPONE ?dup POSTPONE if ; immediate

 : ?DUP-0=-IF ( compilation -- orig ; run-time n -- n| ) \ gforth	  question-dupe-zero-equals-if
    POSTPONE ?dup POSTPONE 0= POSTPONE if ; immediate

----
I don't really see an advantage of writing 
 ?dup-0=-if
over
 ?dup 0= if
if both generate the same code anyway.
