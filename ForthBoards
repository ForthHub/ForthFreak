** TechnoForth ?
** [https://sites.google.com/site/libby8dev/fignition FIGnition] is an AVR-based educational DIY computer which works like an 8-bit home Micro: outputting to composite video and ready to be interactively programmed from the moment you switch it on. It has  8Kb of RAM; 384Kb of storage; an 8-key keypad and runs a JupiterAce influenced variant of FigForth. It uses USB for power; firmware upgrades and program downloads.
