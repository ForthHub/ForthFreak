=== porting to different wiki software ===
As kwiki, the wiki software we are running, is pretty much dead nowadays,
and the wiki is starting to fall apart - recent upgrade of operating system
version didn't pass without leaving traces. For example, editing pages is
turned off now for technical reasons - alternative wiki implementations are
evaluated and examined for suitability. Currently, sputnik is under review.
Both wikis, old and new, will probably be online while migration takes
place. Sputnik is currently 
[http://fachkurs.de/cgi-bin/sputnik.cgi running in a VM under a different domain
]

=== adding a Forth system to ForthSystemsAlphabetical ===
simply put on the last line of the wiki page which describes a Forth system,
the word *!ForthSystems*. After next update run of ForthSystemsAlphabetical (every 4 hours), the thusly marked system will have been added.


=== Page including ===
 After you install this plugin, your are able to use {include: PageName}
 wafl phrase in your Kwiki page content, and that will include
 all content of that page in this one. So it allows you to
 "modualize" your Kwiki pages. You can give a list of page names
 sepearated by comma, or space. They will be included in order.

 For example:

  {include: PageOne}

  {include: PageOne,PageTwo}

  {include: PageOne PageTwo}





=== Additional, more comprehensive, image linking support ===

      {image:http://www.google.com/images/logo.gif http://www.google.com Google inline}

    will render as:

      <a href="http://www.google.com"><img src="http://www.google.com/images/logo.gif" alt="Google" class="inline" /></a>

    For XHTML compliance, a default alt attribute is included if omitted:

      {image:http://www.google.com/images/logo.gif http://www.google.com}

    will render as:

      <a href="http://www.google.com"><img src="http://www.google.com/images/logo.gif" alt="Image" /></a>

    Another example:

      {image:http://www.nowhere.com/images/fancygraph?type=onthefly}

    will render as:

      <img src="http://www.nowhere.com/images/fancygraph?type=onthefly" alt="Image" />
