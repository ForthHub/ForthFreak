Welcome to ForthFreak, the wiki obsessed with Forth.
Some people say Forth is a programming language.
We think it is a little more.

This wiki supports the ForthCommunities by offering a platform for information, knowledge, and code exchange.

== key points of interest ==

* ForthSystems in a variety of implementations
* ForthProjects
* ForthRobots and other hardware controlled with Forth
* ForthTutorials - learn how to write in Forth
* ForthBestPractices - how to write good code in Forth.

== neighbors ==
