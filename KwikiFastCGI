Apache's mod_fastcgi makes Perl applications run much faster and scale well to heavy usage. Using Kwiki with mod_fastcgi is a piece of cake. 

First you need is an Apache server built with mod_fstcgi support. See http://www.fastcgi.com/ for more information.

Then install a Kwiki site following the normal KwikiInstallation procedures.

Finally add something like this to your Apache configuration (The example is for named virtual host):

  <VirtualHost *>
    ServerName kwiki.yourhost.name
    DocumentRoot /usr/local/www/data/kwiki
  
    AddHandler fastcgi-script cgi
    DirectoryIndex index.cgi
  
    <Location />
      Options ExecCGI
    </Location>
  </VirtualHost>

That's it! You'll get an instant *performance boost*.

You can switch from the standard CGI installation to mod_fastcgi anytime you want.
