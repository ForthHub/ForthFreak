Designed and programmed Hence4th in C at specific request of Glen Haydon as traditional/portable FigFORTH platform for Wisc 32 microassembler.

Assisted with development of PFE.

I'm currently finishing up "N-Dex," a N-Dimentional multi-media database written in Emacs Lisp.

I love FORTH and am always interested in consulting.  I've been programming since 1977 and working with FORTH since 1982.  I also know perl, Unix shell(s), m4, assembly (many), C, etc, etc, etc,...
