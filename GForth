The most recent version of GNU Forth is 0.7.0, released in November 2008. It now uses the host gcc/linker to interface with C code, deprecating the previous ffcall interface.

The previous version of gforth was 0.6.2. It included an interface to C code via the ffcall library (though not enabled in the Windows build of gforth). [http://www.shockfamily.net/cedric/fflib.html Documentation on this feature]
