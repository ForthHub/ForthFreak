Forth is a "hands-on" interactive language.
Consider going through a short ForthTutorials first,
then these books will make more sense.

== Recent Stuff ==

(Even these include some of what I believe to be irrelevant and distracting implementation details, but YMMV. --JoshGrams)

* [http://forth.com/forth/forth-books.html Dead-tree books] from Forth, Inc.  _Forth Application Techniques_ is an introductory book, and _Forth Programmer's Handbook_ is more of a reference.
* [http://www.mpeforth.com/arena.htm#papers Programming Forth] by Stephen Pelc of MPE Ltd.
* [http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Forth_Lessons Forth Lessons] for OpenFirmware, but much of it is generally relevant.  I suppose it's really more of a tutorial, but well written and long enough that it sort of counts as a book.

== Journals and Newsletters ==

With the exception of the Euroforth conference, I think these are all now defunct.  But if nothing else, they make for interesting historical reading.
