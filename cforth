cforth is a portable, C-coded FigForth ForthInterpreter written by Allan Pratt in 1985 while a student at Indiana University.

From the documentation:

This is a ForthInterpreter, written entirely in portable C and [Forth].
It requires nothing more than a decent C compiler to use. It is not exactly fast or efficient, but it is a true ForthInterpreter.
