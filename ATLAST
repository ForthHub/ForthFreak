ATLAST is the /Autodesk Threaded Language Application System Toolkit/. 

John Walker wrote ATLAST in an attempt to make software component technology and open architecture applications commonplace in the mainstream software market. It was based on the FORTH-83 standard and was written in C for maximum flexibility. ATLAST is good, if a little bloated. Generally it's speed is satisfactory and it is quite easy to embed into C applications. One especially nice aspect is the extensive documentation in RTF, PostScript, and TeX formats.

ATLAST has been released into the public domain and is written in C.
