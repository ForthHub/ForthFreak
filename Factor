Factor is a dynamic programming language drawing inspiration from Forth, Joy, and LISP. Some key features include:

* Postfix syntax
* Image-based environment
* Dynamic typing
* Dynamic scoping
* Primary compound data types are linked lists, vectors, and namespaces (lists of name/value pairs)
* Rich math library including floating point, ratios, complex numbers
* Continuations
* Integrated HTTP server and image/documentation browser
* Focus on interactive and test-driven development 

There are two implementations of Factor. An interpreter written in C, and an interpreter/compiler written in Java. The C implementation requires GCC running on a Unix-like operating system (or Windows with Cygwin). 32-bit and 64-bit CPUs of both byte orders are supported. The Java implementation requires Java 2 version 1.4. The Java version can also be integrated with JEdit, providing a nice, cross-platform environment for developing programs.
