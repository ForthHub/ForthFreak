the server which hosts this wiki can execute CGI, also as Forth source, loaded into a Forth interpreter (gforth, for example, is installed, and even runs a bit of Forth source as CGI. Here is [http://fwiki.logilan.com an example of Forth source, executed by gforth, upon opening this link]. The Forth source can be opened and viewed from the displayed page, or by [http://fwiki.logilan.com/cgi/fwiki.forth following this link]).


Provided that system as suggested above is meant to be implemented as Forth CGI, there's nothing to keep us from doing it. But I am a bit reluctant to grant write privileges of these CGI sources to world.

More thoughts may be needed towards integrating public sources with - probably local - execution environmen; not many programmers may want to use such a system if considerable efforts to synchronize local with remote sources are required

Agreed. My thought is to have source on the host, and execute tests etc on each user's system. It would be good to put in some sort of claim about which Forths a given source file is certified for, but that's a detail that might go into a lower-level spec.

It should be possible to sandbox a Forth so it can't do anything too disastrous, but I wouldn't want to bet the host on it.
