This is a generic system running on GNU-Linux. It generates x86 Forths, e.g. for Linux, DOS and Windows. In a configuration file you can specify 16 or 32 bits, Dos/linux/windows I/O, memory size, what assembler etc. You then generate an assembly source file, which can be run through an assembler to create an executable.
Other tools extract specific documentation from the source to combine with general documentation into documentation (ps,pdf,info,html) tailored to the Forth generated and tests for all words of the Forth generated.
