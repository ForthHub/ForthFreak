[http://www.computer-solutions.co.uk/ COMSOL (Computer Solutions Ltd)] [http://www.computer-solutions.co.uk/chipdev/cf.htm chipFORTH] is a unique combination of High Level Language, a Real Time Operating system, a PC based compiler and an Interactive Environment. The resulting package provides high productivity without the need for expensive development hardware. Engineers producing software for embedded microprocessors or microcontrollers can now enjoy the considerable advantages (familiar to those who work in BASIC or FORTH) of interactive development in a High Level Language.

The hardware costs are minimal - for most applications, an IBM-PC or compatible is all that is required.
