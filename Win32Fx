A variant of Win32Forth 6.01, that has many advantages including absolute addressing (simpler VM in code), a Library Loader called LibLoad that automaticaly resolves file dependencies with lots of other handy features, and a 5-stack system with the ability to import and run code from "C" prototypes such as are found in the sdk documenation with only minor modification. 

30 megs of Win programming docs also available and linked into the editor.

Does the Forth of the future REALLY need 5 stacks? 

See for yourself. Portable solutions ARE possible, but to decide to stay put when the obvious is in front of us is a decision to go nowhere.

Easier to code, algebraic functions and porting C is a breeze. As a learning tool this system CANNOT be beat.
