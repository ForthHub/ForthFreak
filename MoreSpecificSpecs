Specs for a ForthProjectOrganiser version management system

RegisterUsers  If nobody can modify your stuff but you, the system has to identify you.

FPOCompressionAlgorithm  Clearly useful

FPOTreeStructures  More complex than Wiki because others will keep pointing to old versions.

FPOUploadDownload  Move files and whole versions from computer to computer seamlessly

FPOPortableDevelopmentEnvironment  The wiki structure and load files etc should work locally on deveopers' systems.

DataMining  How can you find out what other people are doing without eyeballing it all?

PortableFileSystem  How do you handle folder/directory trees etc on multiple operating systems, portably?
