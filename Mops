Mops is a programming language and development environment for the Apple Macintosh, written and maintained by Mike Hore. It is an object-oriented native code dialect of the Forth programming language, with origins as a reimplementation of Neon, a commercial programming package sold by Kriya Systems, Inc. in the mid-1980's. 

While Neon died off years ago, Mops has thrived and continued to continued to improve, earning a reputation along the way as being both agile and user-friendly. Uniquely, Mops has included its complete source code in each distribution since its first public release. Sixteen years since its inception, Mops has completed its transition into a fully-native stand-alone development solution for Mac OS X, with its original author still at the helm. 

As a finer example of public domain software, Mops attracts advanced and novice users alike. Whether you have become frustrated with traditional vendor-supported language "solutions", grown resentful of the legal restrictions imposed on you by most developers of commercial software, or even if you never thought you had a reason (before now) to try something different, Mops might be just what you are looking for! 

Please try Mops if you haven't already done so. You will not be disappointed!
