c4w is an adaption of Charles Moore's [colorForth] that runs under Microsoft Windows. Since it is an experiment, a work in progress, is poorly documented, buggy, contains some really bad examples of  forth and assembler, and has only even been run on Windows2000, I am calling this release Pre-Alpha v0.001.

"c4" is an abbreviation for colorForth, "w" is for windows. It is intended that c4w will have brothers or sisters such as c4s which like the original colorForth will run standalone on a Pentium, but in other ways will be like c4w.
