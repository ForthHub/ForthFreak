I especially like the interactivity of Forth.

=== Is there a Forth for the Parallax Propeller? ===

I see that at least 3 people have had a go at implementing Forth for it ...

=== Is there a Forth for the PSoC? ===

Yes, Christopher Burns wrote M8cForth.
David Cary took over over maintenance of M8cForth in 2006.

2007: posted M8cForth source to http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Forth/PSoC_Forth .

2006:
I'm now using Cypress PSoC chips (using the "Cypress M8C core processor").
I'm currently doing mixed C and assembly language on them.
I'm poised to switch to Forth.

An upcoming project is most likely going to use Atmel AVR chips -- I see that there are several Forth versions that run on the Atmel AVR
listed at CrossForth:
ByteForth, [PFAVR], and the "MPE AVR IRTC Forth cross compiler".

2005:
David Cary is currently doing assembly language programming on PIC processors, and is poised to switch to PicForth.
