The Windows-based Forth 6.2 Cross Compilers provide an interactive development system for embedded targets. MPE's VFX optimising code generators are available on a number of targets, producing excellent code quality and density. Customer comments include "Wow!" and "How do you do that?". As always, floating point, multi-tasking, full target source code, manuals and technical support are included as part of the package. Most compilers can be supplied with evaluation boards and prepackaged software configurations.
