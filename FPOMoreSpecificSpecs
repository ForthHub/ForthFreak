=== Specs for ForthProjectOrganiser tools. ===

FPORegisterUsers  If nobody can modify your stuff but you, the system has to identify you.

FPOVersionControl Keeping track of specs, code, tests, and bug reports.

FPOCompressionAlgorithm  Clearly useful

FPOTreeStructures  More complex than Wiki because others will keep pointing to old versions.

FPOUserInterface  Making it easy to use.

FPOUploadDownload  Move files and whole versions from computer to computer seamlessly

FPOPortableDevelopmentEnvironment  The wiki structure and load files etc should work locally on developers' systems.

FPODataMining  How can you find out what other people are doing without eyeballing it all?

FPOPortableFileSystem  How do you handle folder/directory trees etc on multiple operating systems, portably?

FPODefinedInterfaces It's important to have all the seams carefully described, so that someone who doesn't like a feature can easily replace it with something he likes better.
