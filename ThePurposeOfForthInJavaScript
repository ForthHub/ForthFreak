The idea to implement [jsforth], which is a [ForthInterpreter] written in JavaScript, has been around for some time, to link to the tutorial section of the ForthFreak wiki (or other places where people interested in learning about Forth may show up). Having an on-line version of Forth available, which can be executed by simply clicking on a link, should greatly lower the threshold to get started. The potential to integrate tutorial sources with the interpreter is also considerable. The reason why i picked this project up now is because i like to hook it up to the [http://fwiki.logilan.de Wiki written in Forth], which is also getting there. 

This means also that such a ForthInterpreter should stick to one of the ForthStandards. [jsforth] has been written to be [ANSForth] compatible. Its compliance has been documented per word in ForthCoreWords.
