Kwiki supports backing up of each page change, so that you can easily revert a page to an older version. Currently the only backup module is CGI::Kwiki::Backup::Rcs and it uses RCS to do the backups. RCS is generally found on almost all modern Unix systems.

KwikiBackup support is not enabled by default. To enable it, add the following line to your config.yaml file:

    backup_class: CGI::Kwiki::Backup::Rcs
