 \ This implements a subset of the gforth locals syntax in pure ANS Forth
 \ From compat.zip distributed with gforth, probably by Anton Ertl.
 \ This file is in the public domain. NO WARRANTY.

 \ This implementation technique has been described by John Hayes in
 \ the SigForth Newsletter 4(2), Fall '92. He did not do the complete
 \ job, but left some more mundane parts as an exercise to the reader.

 \ I don't implement the "|" part, because 1) gforth does not implement
 \ it and 2) it's unnecessary; just put a 0 before the "{" for every
 \ additional local you want to declare.

 \ The program uses the following words
 \ from CORE :
 \ : bl word count ; >in @ 2dup 0= IF 2drop [char] ELSE THEN drop
 \ recurse swap ! immediate
 \ from CORE-EXT :
 \ parse true 
 \ from BLOCK-EXT :
 \ \ 
 \ from FILE :
 \ ( S" 
 \ from LOCAL :
 \ (local) 
 \ from STRING :
 \ compare 

 : local ( "name" -- )
    bl word count (local) ;

 : {helper ( -- final-offset )
    >in @
    bl word count
    2dup s" --" compare 0= if
      2drop [char] } parse 2drop true
    else
      s" }" compare 0=
    then
    if
      drop >in @
    else
      recurse
      swap >in ! local
    then ;

 : { ( -- )
    {helper >in ! 0 0 (local) ; immediate

 \ : test-swap { a b -- b a } ." xxx"
 \     b a ;

 \ 1 2 test-swap . . .s cr
