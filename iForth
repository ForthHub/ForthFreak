It is a longstanding trend in the computer industry to try and wrest away control from the user. The keyword is 'obfuscation,' or maybe the nicer sounding 'abstraction.' The often-heard excuse is, perhaps surprisingly, 'user-friendliness.' The  resulting outrage is nicely illustrated by trying to write a one-line 'Hello, world!' C program for Windows, using the latest Visual Studio toolset from Microsoft (it's free for download). If you feel a slight unease after completing the above described task, pondering the near future, iForth may be for you.

The primary goal of iForth is to supply its user with a human-to-computer language translator that combines the ease of use and flexibility of an interpreter with the run-time execution speed that is expected of a modern optimizing compiler. A second goal is that this programming environment (the Forth "command line") is completely customizable and can adapt to all features a host Operating System provides. iForth therefore does not hesitate to provide system-dependent features like graphics and sound, although these are layered such that the programming interface is the same on all supported OS's (OSX, Windows, Linux and MSDOS).

Strong points of iForth are its floating-point support (finely tuned GotoBLAS, ATLAS, LaPACK, etc.), its electrical engineering toolsets (plotting and visualization, interfaces to Matlab, Mathematica, Excel etc.), and its truly enormous set of over 4100 non-trivial example programs.
