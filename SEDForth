!SEDForth is a compiler for a subset of an old version of RetroForth. It consists of a small library written in assembly, a SED script, and some shell script wrappers. It was intended to be used to compile small, standalone applications. Two versions were developed.

!SEDForth is no longer being updated, however the code is still provided as a reference for those who may wish to pursue it or similar tools.
