Add these features:
* KwikiSisters
* Page aliasing
* Page renaming/refactoring
* Revision Diff Display
* Support [=javascript/local] and [=css/local]


Most of these features are not specific to ForthFreak.
They should probably go into the underlying
Kwiki engine ( http://kwiki.org/ )
or one of its many plugins ( http://www.kwiki.org/?KwikiPlugins ).

Revision diff display:

Isn't this already supported by the "diff" plugin for the Kwiki wiki engine?
(For example, http://www.kwiki.org/?action=diff&page_name=HomePage&revision_id=-1
).

How can we get this enabled at ForthFreak ?
