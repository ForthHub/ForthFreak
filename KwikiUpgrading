== Upgrading a Kwiki Site ==

After installing the new CGI::Kwiki module, just cd into the old Kwiki directory and reinstall with:

  kwiki-install --upgrade

This will upgrade everything except the config file and the changed pages. Other upgrade options are:

  --reinstall  - Upgrade everything including config file.
  --config     - Upgrade config file. You will lose local settings!
  --scripts    - Upgrade cgi scripts.
  --pages      - Upgrade default kwiki pages unless changed by a user.
  --template   - Upgrade templates.
  --javascript - Upgrade javascript.
  --style      - Upgrade css stylesheets.
