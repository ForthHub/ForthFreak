HelFORTH is a FORTH development system. It's complete in the sense that you can build a more complex system from it. HelFORTH is designed to be a developer friendly, minimal FORTH system. The features of HelFORTH include:

* very small core (less 10K including the disassembler, otherwise about 5K)
* integrated symbolic disassembler in default installation
* code optimizer
* bytecode compressor
* ANS compatiblity layer
