lib4th is a self contained Forth shared library for k6/i568(+) PC Linux, designed after the ANS-Forth standard, with a native code subroutine threaded compiler and interpreter, independent of any external code (particularly, no "libc") but the linux/ELF program interpreter.

It was programmed in Intel style assembler language, NOT designed for portability (though it may be possible), but run-time efficiency, for the most widespread type of "personal computers".
