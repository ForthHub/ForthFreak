The robot controller made by [http://strobotics.com/ ST Robotics] runs a forth system called Roboforth II.  It appears to be a simple traditional Forth system, with supporting code for running their robots.

One obvious departure from usual is that Roboforth's ' (tick) returns the parameter field address for a word, and FIND performs tick's usual function of returning an execution token for the following name.
