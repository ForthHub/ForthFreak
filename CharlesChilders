I am the primary developer of RetroForth and SEDForth. In addition to the development and maintenance of these Forth systems, I have also written some small applications and tools in Forth.

Since January, I've reorganized the RetroForth codebase, and now I'm updating SEDForth as well. I plan to resume work on a ForthInJavaScript. I recently completed the first version of a WikiWrittenInForth.
