There are numerous implementations of Forth. This page is intended to provide an overview of all known implementations. Many Forth systems have been ported to different operating systems and !CPUs. Some run only on specific platforms.

* [colorForth] is a family of Forths that uses colour to replace punctuation. Mostly meant and implemented as StandAloneForth, some [colorForth]s, mostly for training- and evaluation purposes, are running under a host operating system.

There's also a graphical [http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/family-tree/ Forth Family Tree] which (while not covering every Forth system) is quite nice for showing how the various Forths interrelate.
