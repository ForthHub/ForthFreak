the JKForth compiler, interpreter, and runtime system (which is essentially an extremely primitive disk operating system) occupies well under 10K of RAM. And this is my first significant Intel assembly-language project: I'm sure an experienced x86 coder could do a lot better.

And another thing: if you compile a 61-byte "Hello, world" program in C using GCC, the resulting executable is almost 11K (dynamically linked to libc.so). By contrast, the equivalent JKForth program is 27 bytes long and compiles to 39 bytes of object code.

Even more astonishing, the 2K or so Forth source that implements the JKForth utility and editor package compiles into less than 1K of Forth object code.
