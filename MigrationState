----
a way to request page deletion exists: DeleteRequest. The [http://wiki.forthfreak.net/index.cgi?action=keyword_display;keyword=DeleteRequest  pages for which deletion has been requested] will have to be deleted manually, but at least they're listed, and available for peer review. The admin(s) won't rush deletion though.
