Portable Forth Environment

The Portable Forth Environment (PFE) is based on the ANSI Standard for Forth. The PFE has been created by Dirk-Uwe Zoller and had been maintained up to the 0.9.x versions (1993-1995). Tektronix has adopted the PFE package in 1998 and made a number of extensions. It is now fully multithreaded and it features a module system. You can load additional C objects at runtime to extend the Forth dictionary. It is best targeted for embedded environments since you can easily exchange the terminal driver and the initilization routines.

For desktop use, however, PFE has a lot of rough edges.  It is not fully standard; if you go poking around in the corners you'll find several cases where it doesn't work quite right.  For instance:

* Line numbers in error reports are zero based, whereas most editors that I know of use a one-based system.
* It only takes one filename on the command line, and that file is not treated the same as if you !INCLUDEd a file from the keyboard (you can't use BYE, and it resets the search order and other system state before dropping into interactive mode).
* ORDER doesn't display a value for unnamed wordlists (just <???>), so you can't tell them apart.
* .S displays the stack in a vertical format, with both hex and decimal, which is sometimes nice, but generally takes up much more screen real-estate than necessary.
* You can't use DOES> or RECURSE in a :NONAME definition.
* On a segfault, it doesn't restore my terminal state.
* etc...

Obviously none of these are all that bad, but the little annoyances add up...
