Holon is a new interactive integrated programming tool based on Forth. 
* Holon combines all parts of a powerful development tool -- browser, editor, assembler, compiler, linker, debugger and interpreter -- in one closely integrated optimized program. There is nothing to set up among the parts, you can start to develop immediately.
* The user interface of Holon provides a permanent view of your program. All development occurs in the browser: design, editing, compilation, testing, debugging and incremental changing.
* Holon presents the source code as a hierarchical structure of modules, groups and "words". Words are the actual program elements. You enjoy a clearly ordered presentation as well as direct access to every word.
* Holon works interactively on a separate target. Create, test, debug and change the code online in the target system.
* If you add or change a program word in Holon, the executable code is instantly updated in the target. You can change a running program.
