A logo image is something like a "coat of arms" for your kwiki. It is very useful for identifying your kwiki, especially from other wiki sites.

Kwiki formatting looks best when your image is 90x90 pixels. You should also have a second version of your image that renders nicely at 50x50 pixels. This will be used by KwikiSisters to link to your site.
