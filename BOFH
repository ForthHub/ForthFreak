=== BOFH ===
Acronym, Bastard Operator From Hell. A system administrator
with absolutely no tolerance for [luser]s. "You say you need more
filespace? <massive-global-delete> Seems to me you have plenty
left..." Many [BOFH]s (and others who would be [BOFH]s if they could get
away with it) hang out in the newsgroup alt.sysadmin.recovery,
although there has also been created a top-level newsgroup hierarchy
(bofh.*) of their own.
  
Several people have written stories about [BOFH]s. The set usually
considered canonical is by Simon Travaglia and may be found at the
Bastard Home Page. [BOFH]s and [BOFH] wannabes hang out on [http://scarydevilmonastery.net scary devil monastery] and wield [LART]s.
