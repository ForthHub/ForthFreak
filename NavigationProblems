I've got strange problems when moving along links in IE 5.0.
When I move forward with TAB, pages are scrolled opposite direction.
I've no idea why.

I have rebuilt the rcs archive, as consequence all pages appear to have been modified recently. The file page modification date show in the list of updated pages is correct, though.

=== Fixed:
----
Due to a new webserver, and configuration change of it, some file privileges are wrong. This shows as "Software error" when attempting to save a page. Pressing the back button, and saving again, usually helps in that case.

Under the latest (0.8) release of Firefox the "Activity" page renders improperly with some lines overtop other ones.

right. columns are too close together. it disappears with a smaller font. maybe a style sheet issue, haven't figured it out yet. There's the ctrl and - key combination to resize fonts with firefox.

In "Display.css", remove the 

 table-layout: fixed;

line from the table.changes entry. It corrects the columns on my systems, using both Mozilla & FireFox & IE 5.5 & IE 6.0. The last column has a different font than the others though.

yes, that did the trick. much easier on the eye now. thank you!
