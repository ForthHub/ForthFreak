8052-ANS-Forth, an 16 bits ANSI standard implementation for the 8032 processor series, it's available at this moment for the 80(C)32/80(C)52, 80C320, 80C520, 80C552, 80C535 and also runs on the recent 87C251 family from Intel.
8052-ANS-Forth sits in an 32 kByte EPROM and needs a further 32 kByte RAM. the release of turnkey (self starting) programs is free of royalties. Turnkey programs may be in RAM using battery backup, or after relocating with the built in relocater, in may be burned in the unused gap of 8 kByte in EPROM.
